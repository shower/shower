			One very obvious change in the last years was that the web became much more mobile.
			Instead of desktop machines we use laptops, smart phones and tablets and all of

			moving the open web from immobile machines to on-the-go computing.

			beautiful and we all were ready to chip in to make this an open

		<footer class="notes">
			However, when native apps took off a lot of companies realised that there 
			is money to be made by not keeping things open. Apps can do more than 
			HTML5 can because the OS and hardware providers grant them more access and
			control the experience. If you control the software and the hardware, you 
			can build great, but very bespoke products. If you allow for open technologies
			to be used, you lose control and you make less money as a hardware provider.
			As a developer, you shouldn't have to go that route.

			in different resolutions and when you switch from landscape to portrait mode. 
			Instead of resizing the window you resize the document in the browser. It comes
			with lots of presets of the sizes of common phones and tablets and you still
			have access to all the buttons and tabs of your browser.

		<footer class="notes">
			The latest Firefox now allows for remote debugging, which means you

		<footer class="notes">
			The most frustrating part about this is that phone and operating 
			system providers lock out browsers and JavaScript. The fun parts
			to use in a smartphone are the camera, the sensors and to use it
			to send messages to your friends and call people. To do this, 
			however you'll need to write native code. Browsers, in general
			are locked out. This is not fair when you claim at the same 
			time that HTML5 is the platform to bring a great future.

			You can run Firefox OS on your own computer inside Firefox Nightly 
			or with Desktop simulators.
			The easiest is to run it in the browser and build your apps for it 
			with the environment you are familiar with. 
			You can put it on your own phones but the process is not easy (yet)
			The idea of Firefox OS is to bring new, affordable web-enabled phones 
			to people and not to replace Android/iOS.
